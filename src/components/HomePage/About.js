                    Little Lemon was born from a passion for exquisite cuisine
                    and a love for this iconic city. Our journey began with a
                    simple idea â€“ to offer a diverse culinary experience that
                    celebrates Chicago's rich food culture. Today, we're proud
                    to be a cherished part of this vibrant community, inviting
                    guests to savor the flavors of Chicago, one bite at a time.
