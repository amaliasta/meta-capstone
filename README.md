## Overview

The starting point for this project is a fictional family-owned restaurant located in downtown Chicago. The course's main task consisted in creating a web application featuring a home page, a couple of simple layout pages and an interactive reserve-a-table functionality.

## Features

-   Responsive Design: The website is designed to be a fully responsive SPA, ensuring a seamless user experience on different devices and screen sizes.
-   Semantic HTML: HTML best practices learned during the course were followed to ensure proper document structure and accessibility.
-   React Routing: The project incorporates routing with react-router-dom for seamless navigation between different sections.
-   Table Reservations: A booking system was implemented, allowing customers to reserve tables. I used Formik and Yup libraries for form handling and validation. The form was originally intended to connect to an API for dynamic data, but a mock API was created to replicate this functionality in a static website.
-   Regression Testing: unit tests were added to maintain the integrity of existing features.

## Live Demo
